Fun little rarely updating dashboard

Currently, this repo is just an assortment of random views I am creating for the display:

| view                                         | script                    |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Map with precipitation radar overlaid in red | [Mappyboi](./mappyboi.py) |
| Cowsay with Dad jokes                        | [Cowsay](./cowsay.py)     |

**Disclaimer**, this is not my best work - but it's been a bit of lockdown fun :D

## Installation

This requires python3 installed, as well as some other additional components.
